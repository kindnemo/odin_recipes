    <h1>Cheescake</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cheesecake? In a pressure cooker? You bet. A creamy cheesecake relies on beating lots of air into the batter before cooking it. It also requires steaming. When you bake a cheesecake in the oven, you also need to put a pot of hot water underneath the springform pan to ensure the top of the cheesecake does not crack. In an Instant Pot®, all you need is a little water and the trivet. The result is a decadent cheesecake with no fuss. Serve with fruit on top, such as ripe blackberries. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup crushed graham crackers </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons melted butter </li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature </li>
        <li>⅔ cup white sugar </li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
        <li>1 lemon, zested </li>
        <li>2 eggs, at room temperature </li>
        <li>⅔ cup sour cream </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Pulse graham crackers, 2 teaspoons white sugar, and cinnamon in a food processor. Pour in melted butter; pulse until fine crumbs form. Pat the crust into the bottom and 1 inch up the sides of a 6-inch springform pan. Put the pan in the freezer for 20 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Mix cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer on medium-low speed until aerated and creamy, about 4 minutes. Add 2/3 cup sugar and salt; mix for 4 minutes more. Add vanilla extract and lemon zest; mix batter for 1 minute more.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Crack 1 egg into the batter; mix for 1 minute. Add remaining egg; mix for 1 minute more. Stir in the sour cream; mix until it has disappeared into the batter, about 1 minute. Pour into the crust-lined pan. Make a loose tent over the pan with aluminum foil.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Pour 1 1/2 cups of water into the bottom of the Instant Pot®; add the trivet. Lower the filled springform pan carefully into the Instant Pot®. Lock the lid into place.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Choose the "Manual" setting; select high pressure. Set cook time for 40 minutes. When the timer goes off, allow pressure to naturally release for 18 minutes. Remove the lid. Check for doneness; edges should be set and the center should jiggle slightly when shaken.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Transfer the cheesecake to the refrigerator. Chill for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
